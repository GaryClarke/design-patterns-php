NullObject is not a GoF design pattern but a schema which appears frequently enough to be considered a pattern. It has the following benefits:

Client code is simplified
Reduces the chance of null pointer exceptions
Fewer conditionals require less test cases
Methods that return an object or null should instead return an object or NullObject. NullObjects simplify boilerplate code such as if (!is_null($obj)) { $obj->callSomething(); } to just $obj->callSomething(); by eliminating the conditional check in client code.
